# NlpExplainer
NlpExplainer tries to abstract different XAI algorithms for NLP tasks (like classification, QnA, and NER). It is a wrapper around different libraries like Shap, so that in a few lines we can generate Explainable Visualization for NLP Models.

Need to install following  ::
Notebook
```
!pip install torch==1.12
!pip install transformers==4.20.1
!pip install lime==0.2.0.1
!pip install shap==0.41.0
!pip install datasets==2.3.2
```
Plain Python
```
pip install torch==1.12 transformers==4.20.1 lime==0.2.0.1 shap==0.41.0 datasets==2.3.2
```

Some of the features are ::

- 1. Wrapper with Few Lines

- 2. Examples


Currently Shap based explainer is there for Transformers 

```
